# Energy Transitions R Tutorial

Using R, create a plot of primary energy consumption (Quadrillion) versus time from 1635 -2017.

## Read in CSV file

In base R, you can read in data as "dataframes" very easily. However, I would like to get you all in the habit of using "data tables" from the "data.table" library. It's great for later on (should you continue to use R for data analysis) when you will likely encounter larger datasets. Data tables are much more time-efficient to process on than dataframes.

First, let's install the package:

```r
# install.packages("data.table")
```
Then, we can load the data.table library:

```r
library(data.table)
```

Let's now read in the CSV file. If you open the file itself, you can see that the first two rows are not actually data we need. We can specify our code to skip the first two rows.

```r
df_data = fread('data/Primary Energy Consumption_from 1635.csv', skip = 2)
```

Click on the *df_data* object in your work environment to view the entire data table, or run the following code to see the "head" (first 6 rows) of the data table:

```r
head(df_data)
```

```
##      V1 Coal Natural Gas Petroleum Total Fossil Nuclear Hydropower
## 1: 1635    0          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 2: 1645   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA

## 2:        0.001    NA   NA                  0.001
## 3:        0.002    NA   NA                  0.002
## 4:        0.005    NA   NA                  0.005
## 5:        0.007    NA   NA                  0.007
## 6:        0.009    NA   NA                  0.009
```

## Rename year column

The first column, which includes the years, was not assigned a column name since the CSV file does not have a column name in that cell. So, we can manually change the first column as such:

```r
colnames(df_data)[1] = 'year'
head(df_data)
```

```
##    year Coal Natural Gas Petroleum Total Fossil Nuclear Hydropower
## 1: 1635    0          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 2: 1645   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 3: 1655   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 4: 1665   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 5: 1675   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
## 6: 1685   NA          NA        NA            0      NA         NA
##    Wood/biomass Solar Wind Total Renewable Energy
## 1:           NA    NA   NA                  0.000
## 2:        0.001    NA   NA                  0.001
## 3:        0.002    NA   NA                  0.002
## 4:        0.005    NA   NA                  0.005
## 5:        0.007    NA   NA                  0.007
## 6:        0.009    NA   NA                  0.009
```

## Fill NA values

There are a lot of records that are null (NA). Let's set these as equal to zero:

```r
df_data[is.na(df_data)] = 0 
```

## Create new column that's a sum of other columns

Let's create a new column titled 'Other Renewables' that is a sum of Solar and Wind fuel consumption.

```r
df_data[, 'Other Renewables' := Solar + Wind]
tail(df_data)
```

```

```

## Transform data

When plotting a time series of categorical data, it's often easiest to have your data in a "long" format instead of a "wide" format (like above). So, this next step will transform your data so that all the values for the different fuel types will be put into a single column. Another column labeled "Fuel" will specify the type of fuel.


```r
df_long = melt(df_data, id.vars = "year", measure.vars = c(2:12),
               variable.name = "fuel", value.name = "value")
head(df_long)
```

```
##    year fuel value
## 1: 1635 Coal     0
## 2: 1645 Coal     0
## 3: 1655 Coal     0
## 4: 1665 Coal     0
## 5: 1675 Coal     0
## 6: 1685 Coal     0
```

## Remove certain variables 

Let's remove rows where the fuel are the totals ("Total Fossil", "Total Renewable Energy") as well as "Solar" and "Wind" since they're already included in the "Other Renewables" variable. 
The *%in%* selects all rows where the "Fuel" column included in the vector *c("Total Fossil", "Total Renewable Energy", "Solar", "Wind")*. The exclamation point (!) is equivalent to a *not* in the code. Thus, the code is actually selecting all rows where the fuel does NOT equal the listed fuels: 

```r
df_fuels = df_long[! fuel %in% c("Total Fossil", "Total Renewable Energy", "Solar", "Wind")]
```

Alternatively, you can specify the rows with the fuel types you **do** want to keep:

```r
df_fuels = df_long[ fuel %in% c("Coal", "Natural Gas", "Petroleum", "Nuclear", "Hydropower", "Wood/biomass", "Other Renewables")]
```
You can see that the resulting data table are the same either way.

## Create plot of primary fuel consumption over time

### Load ggplot
*ggplot* is a very popular package in R used to create plots. It's incredible versatile and flexible, and we'll be using the package to create the plot.
First, let's install the package:

```r
# install.packages("ggplot2")
```


```r
library(ggplot2)
```
### Rough plotting

```r
lplot = ggplot(data = df_fuels, aes(x = year, y = value, color = fuel)) + geom_line()
lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

### Change axes limits and range

Let's change the title, labels, and axes of the plot.

```r
lplot = lplot + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1635,2018), breaks = seq(1600,2000,50), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,45), breaks = seq(0,45,5)) 
lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

### Specify line colors

```r
lplot = lplot + scale_color_manual(values = c("Petroleum" = "orange",
                                              "Natural Gas" = "red",
                                              "Coal" = "black",
                                              "Nuclear" = "seagreen",
                                              "Hydropower" = "steelblue",
                                              "Wood/biomass" = "brown",
                                              "Other Renewables" = "skyblue"))
lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

### Add title, subtitle, and caption
Be sure to change Prof. Sanders' name to your own and to change the date as well.

```r
lplot = lplot + labs(title = "U.S. Primary Energy Consumption by Source (1635 â€“ 2018)", 
                     subtitle = "Quadrillion British Thermal Units",
                     caption = "Plot created by Kelly Sanders on August 21, 2019",
                     x = NULL,
                     y = NULL,
                     color = NULL) 
lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

### Making the plot prettier

I'm not a huge fan of how the plot looks right now, so let's pretty it up a bit, shall we? First up, let's make it a more minimal plot and change the font to Arial Narrow:

```r
  lplot = lplot + theme_minimal(base_family = "Arial Narrow")
  lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

Better but can still be improved. Let's change the font sizes and styles a bit.

```r
  lplot = lplot + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
                        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = "plain"),
                        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic"),
                        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
                        axis.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "plain"),
                        legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "plain"))
  lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

Okay, now let's get rid of some of the grid lines so that there's only a y-axis line.

```r
  lplot = lplot + theme(panel.grid = element_line(color = "#cccccc", size = 0.2),
                        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "#cccccc", size = 0.2),
                        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
                        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                        plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10),
                        panel.spacing = grid::unit(2, "lines")) 
  lplot
```

![](01_energy-transitions_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

### Removing the legend completely

This next step isn't very necessary, but let's say you don't like having a legend there, and instead you want the fuel source labels to be directly next to the line plot. To do so, first load the following the libraries:

```r
library(directlabels)
library(grid)
```


```r
  lplot_cut = lplot + 
    geom_dl(aes(label = fuel), method = list(dl.trans(x = x + .3), "last.bumpup", cex = 0.8)) +
    guides(color = FALSE) +     
    theme(plot.margin = margin(10, 110, 10, 10))
```

The following chunk cuts the plot and adds labels on top

```r
  lplot_cut = ggplotGrob(lplot_cut)
  lplot_cut$layout$clip[lplot_cut$layout$name == "panel"] = "off"
  # grid.draw(lplot_cut)
```


### Saving plots

To see where your current working directory is, use the *getwd()* function (usually, if you're running this notebook in RStudio, it should already be the location where the notebook is saved on your computer:

```r
getwd()
```

```
## [1] "/Users/MEAS/GitHub/ene215-fall2019/01"
```

If that's not where you want your image files to be saved, you can use the *setwd()* function to change it. 

To save the plot (in the sub-folder named "figs"):

```r
  ggsave(lplot, 
         path = "figs",
         filename = "Figure_Fuel-Consumption-by-Source_KTSanders.png", 
         width = 8.2, 
         height = 4.4, 
         dpi = 600)
```
Be sure to change the filename to your own.


```r
  ggsave(lplot_cut, 
         path = "figs",
         filename = "Figure_Fuel-Consumption-by-Source_KTSanders_V2.png", 
         width = 8.2, 
         height = 4.4, 
         dpi = 400)
```


## Data analysis

### General analysis

We can play around with the data to do some rough analyses.
First, let's see which fuel and year had the highest value of annual fuel consumption:

```r
df_fuels[, .SD[which.max(value)]]
```

```
##    year      fuel    value
## 1: 2005 Petroleum 40.28278
```
So, the largest amount of fuel consumption (in units of quadrillion BTUs) was petroleum consumption in the year 2005. 

But what if we want to know the maximum amount (and the corresponding year) consumed *for each fuel type*? Luckily, we can easily group our function to find the max:

```r
df_fuels[, .SD[which.max(value)], by = 'fuel']
```

```
##                fuel year     value
## 1:             Coal 2005 22.796543
## 2:      Natural Gas 2018 30.964810
## 3:        Petroleum 2005 40.282775
## 4:          Nuclear 2007  8.458589
## 5:       Hydropower 1997  3.640458
## 6:     Wood/biomass 2018  5.127819
## 7: Other Renewables 2018  3.484484
```
We can see that coal consumption peaked in 2005, whereas consumption of natural gas and non-hydro renewables peaked just last year in 2018.

Let's sum up fuel consumption every year, across all fuel types:


```r
agg_annual = df_fuels[, .(value = sum(value)), by = year] # sum fuel consumption by year
```

When was our primary fuel consumption the greatest? Just last year in 2018, it seems.

```r
agg_annual[, .SD[which.max(value)]]
```

```
##    year    value
## 1: 2018 100.8926
```
In fact, over the past 10 years, our total primary fuel consumption has been increasing.

```r
tail(agg_annual, 10)
```

```
##     year     value
##  1: 2009  93.73072
##  2: 2010  97.31806
##  3: 2011  96.59958
##  4: 2012  94.10274
##  5: 2013  96.82439
##  6: 2014  98.00726
##  7: 2015  97.06292
##  8: 2016  97.02785
##  9: 2017  97.43526
## 10: 2018 100.89260
```

But we can see from the table below (as well as the plots we created) that coal consumption has been on the decline, while natural gas and non-hydro consumption have been increasing.

```r
tail(df_data, 10)
```

```
##     year     Coal Natural Gas Petroleum Total Fossil  Nuclear Hydropower

### 10-year changes

To create a calculation of rate of change every 10 years, let's create a sequence of years that we want to include. In this case, we're going to move backwards every 10 years from the most recent year to the earliest year:

```r
year_seq = seq(max(df_fuels[, year]), min(df_fuels[, year]), -10)
year_seq
```

```
##  [1] 2018 2008 1998 1988 1978 1968 1958 1948 1938 1928 1918 1908 1898 1888
## [15] 1878 1868 1858 1848 1838 1828 1818 1808 1798 1788 1778 1768 1758 1748
## [29] 1738 1728 1718 1708 1698 1688 1678 1668 1658 1648 1638
```

Create a new data table to include only those years:

```r
agg_10yr = df_fuels[year %in% year_seq]
head(agg_10yr)
```

```
##    year fuel     value
## 1: 1958 Coal  9.533287
## 2: 1968 Coal 12.330677
## 3: 1978 Coal 13.765575
## 4: 1988 Coal 18.846312
## 5: 1998 Coal 21.655744
## 6: 2008 Coal 22.387437
```

Let's make a new column telling us what the span of years are. Intuitively, we know the years are 10 years apart. 

```r
agg_10yr[, prev_year := year-10]
agg_10yr[, span := paste(prev_year, year, sep = " - ")]
head(agg_10yr)
```

```
##    year fuel     value prev_year        span
## 1: 1958 Coal  9.533287      1948 1948 - 1958
## 2: 1968 Coal 12.330677      1958 1958 - 1968
## 3: 1978 Coal 13.765575      1968 1968 - 1978
## 4: 1988 Coal 18.846312      1978 1978 - 1988
## 5: 1998 Coal 21.655744      1988 1988 - 1998
## 6: 2008 Coal 22.387437      1998 1998 - 2008
```

Calculate the difference and percent difference between each row and the row before it, grouped by fuel type.

```r
agg_10yr[ , diff := value - shift(value), by = fuel]    
agg_10yr[ , perc_diff := (value - shift(value))/shift(value), by = fuel]    
head(agg_10yr)
```

```
##    year fuel     value prev_year        span     diff  perc_diff
## 1: 1958 Coal  9.533287      1948 1948 - 1958       NA         NA
## 2: 1968 Coal 12.330677      1958 1958 - 1968 2.797390 0.29343394
## 3: 1978 Coal 13.765575      1968 1968 - 1978 1.434898 0.11636814
## 4: 1988 Coal 18.846312      1978 1978 - 1988 5.080737 0.36909007
## 5: 1998 Coal 21.655744      1988 1988 - 1998 2.809432 0.14907065
## 6: 2008 Coal 22.387437      1998 1998 - 2008 0.731693 0.03378748
```

Some of the columns are unncessary, so let's just clean up the data table a bit:

```r
agg_10yr = agg_10yr[, c("fuel", "span", "value", "diff", "perc_diff")]
head(agg_10yr)
```

```
##    fuel        span     value     diff  perc_diff
## 1: Coal 1948 - 1958  9.533287       NA         NA
## 2: Coal 1958 - 1968 12.330677 2.797390 0.29343394
## 3: Coal 1968 - 1978 13.765575 1.434898 0.11636814
## 4: Coal 1978 - 1988 18.846312 5.080737 0.36909007
## 5: Coal 1988 - 1998 21.655744 2.809432 0.14907065
## 6: Coal 1998 - 2008 22.387437 0.731693 0.03378748
```
