## Getting started

### Download the repository

Scroll up and click on the green "Clone or Download" button. Select "Download ZIP". We'll likely be updating the repo as we go along in the semester, so I recommend you come back and re-download the repo before every assignment just in case.

If you're a bit more proficient in using Github, you can feel free to either [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)+[sync](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) or [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the repo. 

### Installing Python + Jupyter Notebook

Most (if not all) of the exercises will be completed using Python. If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can follow our [Install Python](https://github.com/S3researchUSC/ene215-fall2019/blob/master/installing-python.md) guide. 

### Installing R + RStudio

While R will likely be utilized less often in this class, for anyone who might be interested in exploring the world of #rstats, occasionally R verions of assignments will be given as well. To install R on your computer, refer to the [Install R](https://github.com/S3researchUSC/ene215-fall2019/blob/master/installing-r.md) guide.
