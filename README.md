## Getting started

### Download the repository

Scroll up and click on the green "Clone or Download" button. Select "Download ZIP". We'll likely be updating the repo as we go along in the semester, so I recommend you come back and re-download the repo before every assignment just in case.

If you're a bit more proficient in using Github, you can feel free to either [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)+[sync](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) or [clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the repo.
