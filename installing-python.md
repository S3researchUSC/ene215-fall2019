# Installing Python

Unlike installing R, you can install Python in a number of different ways, and different people have different opinions/needs/preferences. If you've already installed Python using a different method from what I'm going to go over or if you found another method, that's fine too!

## Can I avoid installing Python completely?

Technically, yes! There are websites such as [CoCal](https://cocalc.com/) that lets you edit Jupyter notebooks (and other computing platforms) on the web, without having to install anything. All you have to do is make an account. While this is completely fine, if you're planning on doing on any coding moving forward, I recommend just going ahead and installing Python on your computer.  

## Installing Anaconda

For beginners, Anaconda is the best way to go. Anaconda is a distribution that comes with many Python editing applications and libraries. You can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Scroll down (or click "Download"), then select the operating system that you use. Download the Python 3.7 version.

(Using Python 3 versus 2 used to be a common debate topic amongst Python programmers. If you have a strong preference using Python 2, feel free to do so. However, just note that the notebooks created for the course will be programmed in Python 3, and if there are any differences between the language versions that cause bugs/errors, we might not be able to help you.) 

After your installation is complete, you should be able to open the Anaconda navigator, which looks something like this:

All of the apps in the image shown above have the "Launch" option because I've already installed them. 

### Using Jupyter Notebooks

A common way to code in Python is through the use of notebooks. Notebooks are great because they're more interactive: you can compile chunks of code at a time, you can have vectors/arrays/dataframes printed in the notebook, you can have plots displayed, etc. We'll mostly be using notebooks in this course since it'll be easier for you to learn along.

Open Jupyter Notebook by clicking "Launch" under Jupyter.

After a moment, a new tab should open on your browser that looks similar to this:

## Installing Python using command line

As you gain more familiarity with Python, you might stop relying on the Anaconda distribution as much. Anaconda comes with the convenience of having everything together in a bundle, but you sometimes have to wait for them to update the whole bundle if you want to just update a single app/library. 

If you're interested in learning how to install Python using command line, I recommend using the [First Python Notebook](https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/index.html) interactive tutorial created by Ben Welsh from the L.A. Times. I like this tutorial because it introduces some good practice tips from someone who uses Python a lot for his job as a data reporter. The entire tutorial goes through the process of getting you familiar with Jupyter Notebook, basic data analysis, data cleaning, and plotting. However, you don't have to go through all of that (unless you're interested). Instead, in the context of installing Python, the [Prerequisites](https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/prerequisites/index.html) goes over how to use command line to install Python, pip, and more.
