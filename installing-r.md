# Installing R and RStudio

## Installing R

You can download and install R [here](https://cran.r-project.org). Follow the instructions depending on what operating system you use.

Once you've installed R, you should be able to open the default R console/app, which looks something like this:

While the R console works just fine, it's not really the most convenient or user-friendly. Most people who code in R use RStudio, and I highly recommend you do the same if you want to get into R. (For anyone reading this who's familiar with the Sublime editor, it *is* possible to compile R code in Sublime, but personally I don't think it's as convenient as RStudio.)

## Installing RStudio

Download RStudio Desktop from the company's website [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

After your installation is finished, you should be able to open the RStudio app, which looks something like this:

You can play around with the editor's appearance if you like to code in a dark environment.
